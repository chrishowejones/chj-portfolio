  desc: As VP of Technology at Obrizum, I worked with the CTO, CPO and Principal Engineer to reorganise the engineers into two product stream teams, a complex subsystem team, and a cloud platform team. The cloud platform team was particularly key as it provides the foundation for the CTO function to move quickly and remain portable across regions while satisfying clients privacy concerns. I also advised the data science team on software engineering principles & architecture. I established a software engineering community of practice to promote good software hygene and worked with the CPO to develop communication channels to the business around maintenance and issue management.

In addition to adding new features/data, I added many new diagnostic tools for the commercial team & wrote 3 new microservices, decommissioned 5 services and rearchitected 6 services. The majority of these were written in Clojure/ClojureScript
